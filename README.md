Result: workflow for identifying level of risks by risk domain and calculating number of affected children in given areas (flood risk zones, hurricane impact area, etc.)

For a given impact area identify:

how many affected children it will include

Examples: the risk assessment components allow:

1) Calculate how many kids under 5 that live in high flood risk zones also are high risk of not getting medical assistance in time?
         - Children under 5 living in high flood risk zones also in High risk of not getting timely medical services: 141,325

	- 82,093 children under age 5 living in  high poverty areas (rate over 50%) are also are high flood risk zones
4) Calculate number of kids that can lose schooling in case of catastrophic event overall in Bangladesh
   - Children between 5 and 10 in Low risk of losing schooling days: 3,766,931
    - Children between 5 and 10 in Medium risk of losing schooling days: 5,893,504
   - Children between 5 and 10 in High risk of losing schooling days: 4,580,140
5) Calculate Children under 5 living in high poverty areas also in High risk of not getting timely medical services due to Amphan?
